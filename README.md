# Interactive Visualization Of Electricity Consumption Prediction Based On Weather Forecast
## Introduction
Electricity consumption prediction is essential to the energy providers to adjust their resource allocation. Researchers from both industry and academia have invest enormous effort on leveraging historical data to predict both short and long term electricity consumption for specific regions. In the recent years, a reliable predictor is increasingly needed on regular customers side as the increasing popularity of electric vehicles and the large electric bills they guaranteed. 

Here, we designed and developed an Azure API, which electricity consumption predictor trained by state-of-art machine learning techniques with huge amount of historical data, for the industrial business need. In addition, with the regular customer in mind, we provide a web-based interactive experience for users to easily exam historical data in NY and view our electricity load prediction for particular regions.    

Although this is a proof-of-concept project, it has a full potential to be productionized and commercialized. The underlying reason is, in addition to  the B2C and B2B model depicted above, this project can be further integrated into smart homes, which can be automatically used in optimizing the electricity cost for the users.
